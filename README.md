# psu-events
We are making a project www.psuevents.com
We plan to develop a web application called PSU Events (https://www.pdx.events) that will track and display activities that are taking place on campus, particularly for students from different nations, because PSU has a diverse student body.
For the entire application we are using technologies like:
 -HTML & CSS, JavaScript for Frontend
 -Python for backend
 -PostgreSQL for DB.

We are a group of 4:
 Krishna Karthik Chava - 906712108
 Hanesh Koganti - 950313629
 Sai Sushma Nutheti - 985611219
 Aashritha Kondaveeti - 942835974
